  We have recently experienced a critical incident affecting a client's server. An unknown threat actor gained unauthorized access, manipulated critical data, and tried to cause system-wide failure before vanishing. 
  There were no ransom demands, no apparent financial motives.

  Your assignment is to analyze the incident and provide insights into how this happened.
