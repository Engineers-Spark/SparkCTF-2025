description: |-
  We got access to some vulnerable server however every command we execute is somehow encoded or encrypted using an unknown algorithm.
  
  We got a PCAP file for you! Can you please help us recover the results of our executed commands! We were also able to simulate the host environment with a Dockerfile.
